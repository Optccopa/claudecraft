# Architecture

Top-level data flow, module boundaries, and the rules that keep them apart.
For threading details see [threading.md](threading.md); for meshing see
[meshing.md](meshing.md).

## Module map

```
app/         Window (GLFW/GLAD lifetime), Application (composition root + state machine)
core/        ThreadPool, ConcurrentQueue, logging — no game knowledge
gl/          RAII handles, ShaderProgram, KHR_debug hookup — no game knowledge
input/       Input — polled wrapper over GLFW callbacks
player/      Camera (pure math), Player (physics, no GL, no GLFW)
render/      Renderer, TextureAtlas, Frustum, Hud — owns ALL chunk GPU state
world/       Chunk, World, ChunkMesher, TerrainGenerator, WorldSave, Raycast — no GL
```

Dependency rules (enforced by review, not tooling):

- `world/` never includes anything from `gl/` or `render/`. Finished meshes
  leave `World::update` as CPU data (`WorldUpdate`) and the renderer uploads
  them. This is what keeps GL on the main thread for free.
- `core/` and `gl/` know nothing about blocks, chunks, or players.
- Only `Application` wires modules together. No module reaches for another
  via globals — there are none.
- `Player` takes `const World&` per call; it holds no world reference.

## Application state machine

`Application::run` drives three states; `Menu` has five screens:

| State | World updated | Physics | Cursor | UI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Menu`/Main | menu world (random seed, distance 8) | none | free | title + PLAY/SETTINGS/QUIT |
| `Menu`/SelectWorld | menu world | none | free | scrollable world list (thumb + name + last-played/mode) + Play Selected/Create New/Edit/Delete/Cancel |
| `Menu`/CreateWorld | menu world | none | free | name + seed fields + game-mode toggle + Create New World/Cancel |
| `Menu`/EditWorld | menu world | none | free | name field + Save/Cancel (renames the selected world) |
| `Menu`/ConfirmDelete | menu world | none | free | dimmed prompt + Delete/Cancel |
| `Playing` | selected world (settings distance) | fixed 60 Hz | captured | crosshair + hotbar |
| `Paused` | selected world (streaming only) | frozen | free | overlay + RESUME/SETTINGS/QUIT TO MENU |
| `Settings` | backdrop of wherever it was opened from | frozen | free | category tabs + value rows + BACK |

ESC transitions are handled once at the top of the frame, *before* the state
runs — a single press must not be consumed by two states in one frame (pause
then instantly resume). ESC walks back one level: Settings → where it was
opened from; CreateWorld/EditWorld/ConfirmDelete → SelectWorld → Main → quit;
Playing ⇄ Paused. Keep any new global hotkeys in that same block.

`Settings` is reachable from both the main menu and pause; `m_settingsFrom`
remembers the return state and picks the backdrop (panning menu world vs the
frozen game world). Values are defined in `app/Settings` (persisted to
`settings.txt` in the data dir, clamped on load, saved on leaving the screen)
and applied live when clicked, across four tabs: VIDEO (render distance
restreams the world, FOV updates the camera, vsync/fullscreen to GLFW, max-fps
caps the loop, smooth lighting remeshes via `World::setSmoothLighting`),
CONTROLS (sensitivity/
invert-Y + rebinds), PACKS (resource-pack stack, see [rendering.md](rendering.md))
and CHEATS (player speed → `Player::setSpeedMultiplier`, block reach → the
raycast). A new setting needs: a `Settings` field + load/save line, a
`settingRow` in `updateSettings`, and its live-apply call.

Every gameplay key is rebindable: `Keybinds` (in `app/Settings`) maps each
action — movement, jump/descend, fly, inventory, drop, and the nine hotbar
slots — to GLFW key codes, persisted as `key.<action>` / `key.hotbarN` lines.
The CONTROLS tab shows one row per action in two columns (movement+mouse
left, hotbar right); clicking enters capture mode and the next pressed key
binds (ESC cancels). Gameplay input reads only `m_settings.keys` — never raw
key constants — so new actions go through the same table.

World identity comes from `world/WorldList`: the SelectWorld screen lists the
data dir's `saves/` (newest first), each row showing a block thumbnail, the
folder name, and the last-played time + game mode; a click selects the row and
the bottom actions (Play Selected/Edit/Delete) operate on it. The list scrolls
with the wheel and clips to its band without scissor (rows fully outside are
skipped). Edit renames via `worldlist::rename` (re-sanitised, suffixed on
collision); Delete goes through ConfirmDelete to `worldlist::remove`. The
CreateWorld form has two click-to-focus text fields, name and seed; an empty
seed is random, an integer is used directly, and any other text is hashed
(FNV-1a) so the same string always yields the same world (see
[save-format.md](save-format.md)). `startGame` and `enterMenu` are the
only world-lifecycle functions: each resets the outgoing `World` (its
destructor blocks until worker jobs finish, saving modified chunks) and
calls `Renderer::clearChunkMeshes()`, so two worlds never coexist and the
renderer never holds meshes for a dead world.

The menu world is a throwaway: random seed each launch (and again on quit-
to-menu), never modified, so it writes nothing to disk. Text input for the
name field comes from `Input::typedText()` (GLFW char callback, printable
ASCII, key-repeat-aware backspace).

## Frame loop

```
beginFrame (input edge reset) → glfwPollEvents
ESC state transition
state update:
    gameplay input → fixed-step physics (accumulator) → World::update
    → renderer uploads/removals → 3D render → HUD batch
hud.flush (single draw)
swapBuffers → frame cap → title-bar stats
```

Physics runs at a fixed 1/60 s; rendering is uncapped by default and
interpolates the player position by `accumulator / dt`
(`Player::eyePosition(alpha)`). The `maxFps` setting (0 = unlimited, else
30..540) paces the loop with a sleep-then-spin limiter after `swapBuffers`,
skipped when vsync already paces.
Frame gaps are clamped to 0.25 s so a debugger pause doesn't spiral the
accumulator. Look (yaw/pitch) updates at render rate for latency; movement
intent is sampled into `PlayerInput` and applied in the fixed step.

## Ownership and lifetime

- Every GL object lives in a move-only RAII wrapper (`gl/GlObjects.hpp`,
  `gl/ShaderProgram`). Constructors require a current context; the moved-from
  state is id 0 and destruction of id 0 is a no-op.
- `Application`'s member declaration order is load-bearing: `m_pool` is
  declared before the worlds so destruction (reverse order) tears down each
  `World` — whose destructor waits for its in-flight jobs — while the pool
  still exists. Don't reorder those members.
- `Window` is pinned (copy and move deleted): it owns process-wide GLFW
  init/terminate.

## Coordinates

- World space: +y up, chunk (cx, cz) spans x ∈ [16·cx, 16·cx+16).
- Chunk-local indexing `(x·16 + z)·256 + y` — y contiguous, so a vertical
  column is one `memcpy` (terrain fill, mesh snapshots, RLE saves all lean
  on this).
- `wx >> 4` / `wx & 15` for chunk coord / local coord — arithmetic shift
  floors correctly for negatives where `/ 16` wouldn't.
- HUD space: pixels, origin bottom-left, y up. Cursor coords from GLFW are
  window-relative y-down and get flipped + DPI-scaled in
  `Application::mouseUiPosition`.
